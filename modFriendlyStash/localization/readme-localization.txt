Edit corresponding csv file with notepad or notepad++, save as UTF-8 encoded text.

Mail the result to me: wghost81@gmail.com.

If there's no localization file for your language, create it from en.csv file.

If you want to encode localization file yourself, you need W3 strings encoder.

Here's an encoding example:
w3strings.exe --encode en.csv --id-space 2824
